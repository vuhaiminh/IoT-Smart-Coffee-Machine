In the past week, we've implemented voice commands for room light to turn on/off.
to read in current temperature. The data is sent back and current temperature will be
read back to the user.

In the coming week, we hope to finish majority of our project. We will be implementing
the coffee machine feature by using a servo to turn it on and get it ready.
If time allows, we would like to add an additional voice command feature.

We currently have no concerns.
