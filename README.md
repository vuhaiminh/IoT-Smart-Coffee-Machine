Our project is essentially a smart wake up system. Users can set a time to be woken up by the alarm. The alarm can be snoozed or stopped through UI buttons and voice command. When the alarm stops, the application will tell the user the current temperature and predicted forecast of the day. Users can also get temperature through UI buttons in the advanced-feature page. Temperature could also be read aloud through voice command by saying "what is the temperature?". When the alarm stops, the application will also ask if you would like coffee. If the answer is "yes", the servo motor will start and turn on the coffee machine. This can also be done with a UI button. The coffee machine will turn off on its own automatically. If the answer is anything but yes, it will no nothing. As an overal feature, we have an LED light representing the light in the room. The light is turned on/off by voice command "lights off" and "lights on".
