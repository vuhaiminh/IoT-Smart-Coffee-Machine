In the past week, the group has implemented the functionality of turning on the coffee machine
when the option is checked off through the UI. This functionality is implemented using a
hobby servo. Essentially when the checkbox is checked, and assuming the alarm goes off,
the servo will be activated to push the on button and get the coffee machine started.

In the next 2 days we will to combine all the code into 1 and add the alarm (time) functionality,
which shouldn't be too difficult to implement.

A potential concern that we have is for the servo is actually press on the coffee machine button.
A potential solution is adding an additional attachment to the handle to make it longer for better reach.
